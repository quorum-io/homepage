      <p class="paper-subtitle">Pool-internal calling by default, external calling opt-in</p>
      <p class="paper-version">Version 0.1 • January 2026</p>

    <!-- Abstract -->
    <div class="abstract">
      <p>Phone provides end-to-end encrypted voice calling infrastructure for Node pool members. Unlike traditional phone systems or Signal, Phone has no phone numbers, no central servers, and operates on a permission model that prioritizes security over convenience.</p>
      
      <p>The default behavior is pool-internal calling: any pool member can call any other pool member with zero additional permissions. This solves the majority use case (team coordination, family communication, organizational collaboration) while maintaining maximum security.</p>
      
      <p>External calling is explicitly opt-in through four security levels. Users trade security for reach on their terms. Level 0 (Closed) permits only pool-internal calling. Level 1 (Whitelist) enables personal connections across pools through mutual credential exchange. Level 2 (Pool Whitelist) allows governance-managed pool-to-pool relationships. Level 3 (Open) accepts calls from any established pool, with built-in safeguards against abuse.</p>
      
      <p>This paper specifies the technical protocol, permission model, attack resistance properties, and design philosophy of Phone.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 0: Node Integration -->
    <div class="paper-section">
      <h2>0. Prerequisite: Node Integration</h2>
      
      <p>Phone is not a standalone product. Access requires valid Node pool membership - this architectural constraint is fundamental to the protocol's trust model.</p>
      
      <h3>0.1 Why Phone Cannot Be Standalone</h3>
      <p>Voice calling infrastructure requires several trust primitives that Phone cannot provide independently:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity verification:</strong> Proving users are unique humans, not sock puppets</li>
        <li><strong>Sybil resistance:</strong> Preventing attackers from creating unlimited accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Trust scoring:</strong> Reputation system to identify trustworthy participants</li>
        <li><strong>Revocation mechanism:</strong> Democratic process to ban bad actors</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralized coordination:</strong> Governance without central authority</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Node already provides all of these through Argon2id authentication (computational cost prevents sybils), witness verification (humans confirm humanity), trust scores (reputation from governance participation), pool consensus (democratic revocation), and P2P architecture (no central point of failure).</p>
      
      <p>Attempting to rebuild this infrastructure in Phone would duplicate Node's entire trust layer. The dependency is architectural necessity, not arbitrary coupling.</p>
      
      <h3>0.2 Authentication Flow</h3>
      <p>When Alice attempts to call Bob, the following verification occurs before any audio transmission:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pool membership check:</strong> Alice's client proves she is member of valid Node pool</li>
        <li><strong>Credential presentation:</strong> Alice presents cryptographic credential signed by pool consensus</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Bob's client (or rendezvous gate) validates credential against pool's public state</li>
        <li><strong>Permission check:</strong> Bob's security level determines if call is permitted (pool-internal, whitelist, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Connection establishment:</strong> If approved, encrypted P2P session begins</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>This process occurs at the network layer before call establishment. Failed authentication blocks connection immediately.</p>
      
      <h3>0.3 Revocation Cascades</h3>
      <p>When Node pools revoke membership (through consensus mechanism), the revocation immediately propagates to Phone access:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Revoked credentials fail authentication at network layer</li>
        <li>Active calls from revoked members terminate within 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Revoked members cannot establish new calls until pool membership restored</li>
        <li>No central authority required - pool consensus determines access</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This creates accountability: malicious behavior in governance context results in communication privilege loss. Users cannot compartmentalize reputations across products.</p>
      
      <h3>0.4 Privacy Preservation</h3>
      <p>Node gating does NOT compromise call privacy. The integration preserves Phone's core privacy guarantees:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content remains encrypted:</strong> Pool membership verifies identity, not call content. End-to-end encryption unchanged.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata minimization:</strong> Authentication and routing are separate operations. Gates verify credentials without logging call metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>No central authority:</strong> Pool consensus determines membership, not centralized identity provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Compartmentalization:</strong> Pool membership for Phone is independent of other contexts. Users control identity linkage.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The tradeoff is deliberate: sacrifice anonymous calling to gain accountable communication infrastructure without corporate surveillance.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 1: Permission Model -->
    <div class="paper-section">
      <h2>1. Permission Model: Pool Fortress with Controlled Permeability</h2>
      
      <p>Phone implements a hybrid permission model that prioritizes security while enabling controlled external communication. The default behavior is pool-internal calling only - maximum security, zero external attack surface. External calling is explicitly opt-in through four security levels.</p>
      
      <h3>1.1 Default: Pool-Internal Calling</h3>
      <p>Any pool member can call any other pool member without additional permissions. Pool membership itself IS the permission grant. This works because Node pools already implement strong trust primitives:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Argon2id authentication:</strong> Pool members already proved computational cost of entry (64MB memory, 3 iterations, 4 threads parallelism)</li>
        <li><strong>Witness verification:</strong> Pool members verified by other humans through witness mechanism (minimum 3 witnesses required)</li>
        <li><strong>Governance accountability:</strong> Members who spam or abuse calling privileges face revocation through consensus vote</li>
        <li><strong>Social pressure:</strong> Small pool size (typically 5-150 members) enables reputation tracking and social consequences for bad behavior</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Pool-internal calling requires no additional waiting period, no permission requests, no complexity. Join pool → immediately call other members. This solves approximately 80% of secure voice use cases: team coordination, family communication, organizational collaboration, activist cell coordination.</p>
      
      <h3>1.2 External Calling: Opt-In Security Levels</h3>
      <p>For communication outside your pool, users choose their exposure level. Each level trades security for reach - users make informed decisions about acceptable risk. The four levels are:</p>
      
      <h4>Level 0: Closed (Default)</h4>
      <p>No external calling permitted. Users in Level 0 cannot call anyone outside their pool, and nobody outside their pool can call them. This is the default for all users upon joining any pool.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Technical enforcement:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>if caller.pool != recipient.pool:
    reject_call("External calling disabled")
    return</code></pre>
      
      <p><strong>Use case:</strong> Private teams, families, sensitive organizations where all necessary communication happens internally. Maximum security posture.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Attack surface:</strong> Zero. Completely immune to external spam, harassment, or reconnaissance attacks.</p>
      
      <h4>Level 1: Whitelist</h4>
      <p>Users maintain an explicit allow-list of external contacts. Contacts are added through mutual credential exchange via one of three methods:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>QR code exchange:</strong> In-person meeting or video call, scan each other's QR codes containing public keys and pool identifiers</li>
        <li><strong>Invite link:</strong> Generate one-time cryptographic invite link, share via secure channel (Signal, PGP email, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Pool introduction:</strong> Mutual pool member creates cryptographic introduction vouching for connection</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Once added as contacts, both parties can call each other freely. Contact relationships are bilateral - if Alice adds Bob, Bob must independently add Alice for bidirectional calling.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Technical enforcement:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>if caller in recipient.whitelist:
    allow_call()
else:
    reject_call("Not in contact list")</code></pre>
      
      <p><strong>Use case:</strong> Personal connections across pools (friends in different organizations), cross-organizational individual relationships (specific contacts at partner companies), distributed team members in separate pools.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Attack surface:</strong> Contact request spam (annoying but not harassing - requests are not calls). Mitigated by:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Rate limiting: 10 contact requests per day maximum</li>
        <li>Trust point cost: Each request costs 1 trust point (earned through governance participation)</li>
        <li>Blocking: Recipients can block request senders permanently</li>
        <li>Non-intrusive: Requests don't ring device, reviewed asynchronously</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Level 2: Pool Whitelist</h4>
      <p>Pool governance manages trusted pools. Trust relationships established through democratic process:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Pool member proposes "Trust Pool XYZ" via governance interface</li>
        <li>Proposal includes Pool XYZ's identifier, reputation metrics, and rationale</li>
        <li>Supermajority vote required (same threshold as other governance decisions, typically 66-75%)</li>
        <li>If approved, trust relationship established bidirectionally (both pools' members gain calling access)</li>
        <li>Trust can be revoked through subsequent proposal and vote</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Pool trust is bilateral by default - if Pool A trusts Pool B, members of both pools can call each other. This enables organization-to-organization relationships without individual permission management overhead.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Technical enforcement:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>if recipient.pool.trusts(caller.pool):
    allow_call()
else:
    reject_call("Pool not trusted")</code></pre>
      
      <p><strong>Use case:</strong> Partner organizations (companies with established business relationships), allied activist groups (coordinated organizing across multiple cells), federated networks (universities, research institutions, professional associations).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Attack surface:</strong> Compromised pool could propose trusting spam pool. Mitigated by:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Supermajority requirement makes manipulation difficult (attacker must control majority of voting pool)</li>
        <li>Pool reputation is visible before vote (new/suspicious pools obvious to members)</li>
        <li>Revocation capability if spam occurs (quick governance response possible)</li>
        <li>Governance transparency (suspicious proposal patterns visible to all members)</li>
        <li>Social stakes (pools that approve spam pools damage their own reputation)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Level 3: Open</h4>
      <p>Accept calls from any Tier 2+ pool. This is high-risk, high-accessibility mode designed for public figures, community organizers, and support roles who prioritize reachability over protection from spam.</p>
      
      <p>Caller pool must meet Tier 2 requirements to place calls to Level 3 users:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 15+ days since pool creation</li>
        <li><strong>Size:</strong> 5+ active members</li>
        <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Demonstrated governance activity (proposals submitted, votes cast)</li>
        <li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Members have witness verification from other humans</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Built-in safeguards for Level 3 users:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> Maximum 10 external calls per hour (prevents flood attacks)</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency close:</strong> Instant switch to Level 0 if overwhelmed (single button press)</li>
        <li><strong>Individual blocking:</strong> Block specific callers permanently with single action</li>
        <li><strong>Call screening:</strong> See caller's pool name, age, reputation before answering</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-blocking:</strong> Automatically block pools with spam reports from multiple Level 3 users</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Technical enforcement:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>if caller.pool.tier >= 2:
    if recipient.external_call_count_last_hour < 10:
        allow_call()
    else:
        reject_call("Rate limit exceeded")
else:
    reject_call("Caller pool not established")</code></pre>
      
      <p><strong>Use case:</strong> Public figures needing accessibility (activists, organizers, journalists), community organizers coordinating across many pools, support roles for decentralized projects, anyone prioritizing discoverability over spam protection.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Attack surface:</strong> Spam from Tier 2+ pools possible. Attacker must invest significant resources to create Tier 2 pool (15 days wait + governance activity + witness verification + Argon2id computation for 5+ members), making sustained spam campaigns expensive in time and computation. Even successful attacks limited by rate limiting and blocking.</p>
      
      <h3>1.3 Attack Resistance Analysis</h3>
      
      <h4>Attack Scenario 1: Pool-Internal Spam</h4>
      <p><em>Attacker joins legitimate pool, spams members with unwanted calls.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Defense mechanism:</strong> Pool governance revokes attacker through consensus vote. Revocation proposal can be submitted by any member experiencing spam. Supermajority vote triggers immediate revocation. Revoked member loses all Phone access instantly (active calls terminated within 30 seconds, new calls blocked at network layer).</p>
      
      <p>Small pool size (typically 5-150 members) enables effective social pressure. Unlike massive centralized platforms where individual bad actors can hide in millions of users, small pools create reputation accountability. Members know each other through governance participation, making spam socially costly.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> High. Self-moderation extremely effective in small communities with shared stakes. Historical precedent: small online communities (forums, IRC channels, Discord servers under 150 members) successfully moderate without centralized authority.</p>
      
      <h4>Attack Scenario 2: Sock Puppet Pool</h4>
      <p><em>Attacker creates pool with 10 sock puppet accounts, waits to become Tier 2, sets Level 3, begins spam campaign against open users.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Defense mechanism:</strong> Multi-layered. (1) Argon2id computation cost: 64MB memory × 3 iterations × 4 threads × 10 accounts = significant computational investment (approximately 10 minutes per account on typical hardware, 100 minutes total sequential). (2) Witness requirements make sybil verification expensive - attacker must coordinate witnessing between fake accounts without detection patterns. (3) 15-day time gate delays attack launch (cannot spam immediately). (4) Governance activity requirement means attacker must generate convincing proposals and votes for 15 days (automation detectable through pattern analysis). (5) Even after reaching Tier 2, can only call Level 3 users who explicitly opted into spam risk (Level 0/1/2 users completely protected). (6) First credible spam reports trigger pool investigation and potential downgrade to Tier 1, cutting off attack vector.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> High. Multi-factor defense makes attack expensive in time (15 days minimum), computation (Argon2id × accounts), and attention (must maintain convincing governance activity). Even successful attacks limited to small subset of users (Level 3 only) and quickly terminated once detected.</p>
      
      <h4>Attack Scenario 3: Whitelist Spam</h4>
      <p><em>Attacker with legitimate Tier 2 pool membership sends 1000 contact requests to Level 1 users across many pools.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Defense mechanism:</strong> Contact requests are not calls - recipient experiences no device interruption. Requests appear in queue, reviewed asynchronously at recipient's convenience. Rate limiting caps requests at 10 per day (would take attacker 100 days to send 1000 requests). Trust point cost (1 point per request) means attacker exhausts trust score after approximately 30 requests (trust points earned slowly through governance participation, approximately 1 point per significant action). Recipients can block request senders with single action, permanently blocking all future requests from that pool member. Pattern detection can identify mass request senders and automatically flag for investigation.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate-High. Request spam is annoying but fundamentally less harmful than call spam (no intrusion, no urgency, easy to ignore). Rate limiting and trust point economics make mass campaigns impractical.</p>
      
      <h4>Attack Scenario 4: Pool Whitelist Poisoning</h4>
      <p><em>Attacker infiltrates Pool A through legitimate means, builds trust over time, proposes trusting Pool B (attacker's spam pool), vote passes, spam begins.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Defense mechanism:</strong> Supermajority vote requirement (66-75% threshold) makes manipulation difficult - attacker must convince majority of pool, not just gain trust of a few members. Pool reputation is visible during proposal phase (Pool B's age, size, activity, witness patterns, external reputation). Members can research proposed pool before voting. If spam occurs post-trust, pool trust can be revoked through subsequent proposal and vote (emergency revocation proposals can be fast-tracked). Governance transparency means suspicious proposal patterns visible to all members (attacker proposing trust for multiple low-reputation pools raises red flags). Social stakes discourage careless voting - pools that approve spam pools damage their own reputation in federated network.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate-High. Requires attacker to invest significant time building legitimate reputation in target pool (months potentially), succeed in manipulating supermajority vote (difficult), and maintain attack before detection and revocation (limited time window). Success rate low relative to investment required.</p>
      
      <h4>Attack Scenario 5: Compromised Legitimate Pool</h4>
      <p><em>Large established pool gets compromised - attacker gains control of majority voting power through coordinated account acquisition or social engineering. Uses control to approve trust relationships with spam pools or directly spam through compromised accounts.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Defense mechanism:</strong> This attack is fundamentally difficult to defend against at protocol level - if attacker controls pool consensus mechanism, they control pool's Phone access. However, several mitigations exist: (1) Members can exit compromised pool and join/create alternative pool (pool membership is not permanent, switching cost is low). (2) Other pools can revoke trust relationships with compromised pool (cutting off cross-pool spam). (3) Individual users can switch to Level 0 (closing all external access regardless of pool trust settings). (4) Pattern detection at network level can identify compromised pools through spam reports and downgrade pool tier automatically.</p>
      
      <p>Importantly, this attack vector breaks Node governance too, not just Phone. If attacker controls pool consensus, they control all pool functions. This is fundamental to decentralized governance model - no central authority exists to override malicious majority. Defense is exit (leave compromised pool) rather than voice (appeal to authority).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Low. This attack is theoretically possible but extremely difficult in practice (requires compromising majority of active pool members). When it occurs, blast radius is limited (other pools remain unaffected) and victims have immediate exit option. Historical precedent from blockchain governance: majority attacks are rare and expensive, typically only affecting small/young pools with few active participants.</p>
      
      <h3>1.4 User Experience Flow</h3>
      
      <h4>New User Journey (Individual)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>User downloads Phone application, prompted to join or create Node pool</li>
        <li>Completes Node pool membership process (Argon2id authentication, witness verification, typically 12-24 hours)</li>
        <li>Phone access granted immediately for pool-internal calling (Level 0 default)</li>
        <li>User can call any pool member without additional steps (zero friction internal calling)</li>
        <li>User attempts to call external contact, receives prompt: "Add as contact to enable calling" (Level 1)</li>
        <li>User exchanges credentials with external contact via QR code/invite link/introduction</li>
        <li>After mutual credential exchange, both parties can call freely</li>
        <li>User can add unlimited contacts at Level 1 (subject to rate limiting during contact request phase)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Organization Journey (Company/Team)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization creates Node pool for members (or uses existing governance pool)</li>
        <li>All members complete witness verification within pool</li>
        <li>Phone internal calling works immediately for all verified members (daily standups, quick syncs, urgent coordination)</li>
        <li>Partnership with external organization develops, cross-org calling needed</li>
        <li>Member submits governance proposal: "Trust [Partner Org] Pool for Phone access"</li>
        <li>Proposal includes partner pool identifier, reputation data, business justification</li>
        <li>Pool votes on proposal (supermajority required, typically 3-7 day voting period)</li>
        <li>Vote passes, Level 2 (pool whitelist) enabled automatically for both organizations</li>
        <li>Cross-org calling now possible without individual contact management</li>
        <li>If partnership ends or spam detected, revocation proposal submitted and voted</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Public Figure Journey (Activist/Organizer)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Public figure joins or creates Node pool (potentially pool of one for solo activists)</li>
        <li>Pool reaches Tier 2 status (15 days + governance activity + witnesses)</li>
        <li>Public figure explicitly switches Phone to Level 3 (Open) to accept calls from any Tier 2+ pool</li>
        <li>Begins receiving calls from broader community (other activists, supporters, journalists)</li>
        <li>Experiences some spam calls (accepted tradeoff for accessibility)</li>
        <li>Uses call screening to preview caller's pool before answering</li>
        <li>Blocks individual spammers permanently (one-click block)</li>
        <li>If overwhelmed by volume, uses emergency close feature (instantly drops to Level 0)</li>
        <li>Can return to Level 3 when ready, with blocked list preserved</li>
        <li>Alternatively, switches to Level 1 (whitelist only) for more controlled access while maintaining key external contacts</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>1.5 Design Philosophy and Tradeoffs</h3>
      <p>This permission model embodies several core principles that shaped Phone's architecture:</p>
      
      <p><strong>Security by default, accessibility by choice.</strong> The default posture (Level 0) prevents all external attacks. Zero spam, zero harassment, zero reconnaissance. Users who need broader reach must explicitly opt-in, accepting known and disclosed risks. This inverts typical consumer product design (maximize growth) in favor of security-first architecture.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Governance as trust infrastructure.</strong> Pool consensus provides accountability without centralized authority. Communities moderate themselves through democratic process. When spam occurs, victims have immediate recourse through governance proposals. No waiting for corporate support ticket, no appealing to opaque moderation systems. Justice is local and fast.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Honest tradeoffs.</strong> We do not claim to enable open communication AND prevent spam. These goals are fundamentally opposed. Users choose: security (Level 0) or reach (Level 3). The tradeoff is explicit, documented, and enforced at protocol level. Marketing does not promise impossible outcomes.</p>
      
      <p><strong>No phone replacement.</strong> Phone is secure calling for trusted groups, not general-purpose telephony. Users cannot call restaurants, taxi services, customer support lines, emergency services. This scoping is intentional. Phone solves different problems than PSTN, optimizing for trust and privacy rather than universal reachability.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Accept smaller network for better properties.</strong> Phone will never have billions of users. The friction of Node pool membership, explicit security level choices, and default closed posture prevent viral consumer growth. This is acceptable - Phone targets specific use cases (teams, organizations, activists, families) where trust infrastructure provides value exceeding onboarding cost. Growth is not the goal; utility for target users is.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Time as security primitive.</strong> 15-day pool age requirement uses time as anti-spam mechanism. Attackers cannot instantly spam - they must wait. This breaks the economics of mass spam campaigns (which depend on rapid scaling). Patient attackers can still reach Tier 2, but time investment limits attack profitability and creates detection windows.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Composable security levels.</strong> Four discrete levels (rather than continuous spectrum) create clear mental models. Users understand what each level means and can reason about risks. Level boundaries are distinct and enforceable. This aids both users making decisions and developers implementing protocol.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Technical Protocol -->
    <div class="paper-section">
      <h2>2. Technical Protocol Specification</h2>
      
      <h3>2.1 Cryptographic Primitives</h3>
      
      <h4>Symmetric Encryption</h4>
      <p>Phone uses ChaCha20Poly1305 authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) for all voice packet encryption. ChaCha20 is a stream cipher providing confidentiality. Poly1305 is a message authentication code providing integrity and authenticity.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key properties:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>256-bit keys</li>
        <li>96-bit nonces (never reused within key lifetime)</li>
        <li>Associated data includes packet sequence number and session identifier</li>
        <li>Authentication tag: 128 bits</li>
        <li>Encryption overhead: 16 bytes per packet</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Key Exchange</h4>
      <p>Phone uses X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key agreement. X25519 provides strong security (approximately 128-bit security level) with excellent performance characteristics.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key derivation:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Each party generates ephemeral X25519 keypair</li>
        <li>Public keys exchanged during call setup</li>
        <li>Shared secret derived via ECDH operation</li>
        <li>HKDF-SHA256 extracts symmetric keys from shared secret</li>
        <li>Separate keys for each direction (Alice→Bob, Bob→Alice)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Forward secrecy:</strong> Ephemeral keys are generated per-session and discarded after call ends. Compromise of long-term identity keys does not compromise past call content.</p>
      
      <h4>Authentication</h4>
      <p>Phone leverages Node pool membership for authentication. Each pool member has long-term Ed25519 signing key bound to pool identity through consensus mechanism.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Authentication flow:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Caller signs call initiation message with Ed25519 key</li>
        <li>Message includes: caller identity, recipient identity, timestamp, ephemeral public key</li>
        <li>Recipient verifies signature against caller's public key (retrieved from pool state)</li>
        <li>Recipient checks permission level to determine if call allowed</li>
        <li>If approved, recipient signs response and sends ephemeral public key</li>
        <li>Both parties derive shared secret and begin encrypted session</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>2.2 Network Transport</h3>
      
      <h4>UDP/IP Direct Connection</h4>
      <p>Phone uses UDP for voice packet transport. UDP provides lower latency than TCP (no handshake, no retransmission delay) at cost of reliability. For real-time voice, latency more critical than reliability - missing packets cause brief audio dropouts, delayed packets cause conversation lag.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Packet structure:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>[Session ID: 8 bytes]
[Sequence Number: 4 bytes]
[Timestamp: 8 bytes]
[Encrypted Audio: variable]
[Auth Tag: 16 bytes]</code></pre>
      
      <p><strong>Packet size:</strong> 20ms audio frames at 48kHz = 960 samples. Opus compression produces approximately 60-160 bytes per frame (depending on bitrate setting). Total packet size: approximately 100-200 bytes.</p>
      
      <!-- REPLACE lines 409-421 -->
      <h4>NAT Traversal Strategy</h4>
      <p><strong>Priority 1: Mesh VPN (Recommended):</strong> Phone detects mesh VPN environments (Tailscale/Headscale 100.64.0.0/10, WireGuard 10.0.0.0/8) and uses direct addressing. Mesh VPN eliminates NAT entirely, providing stable IPs and direct connectivity. All peers get direct peer-to-peer connections with no traversal complexity.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Priority 2: Public STUN (Fallback):</strong> When mesh VPN unavailable, Phone implements STUN-like NAT hole punching for direct peer-to-peer connections. Process:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Both parties send UDP packets to rendezvous server (public or self-hosted)</li>
        <li>Server observes external IP:port mappings for both parties</li>
        <li>Server sends mapping information to both parties</li>
        <li>Parties attempt direct connection using observed mappings</li>
        <li>If direct connection succeeds, server no longer involved</li>
        <li>If direct connection fails (symmetric NAT), server relays packets (fallback)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Privacy note:</strong> Mesh VPN approach leaks no metadata to external parties. Public STUN servers see IP addresses during setup but not call content (encrypted). Consider self-hosting rendezvous servers or using Headscale for maximum privacy.</p>
      
      <h3>2.3 Audio Codec</h3>
      
      <h4>Opus Encoding</h4>
      <p>Phone uses Opus codec at 48kHz sample rate. Opus is specifically designed for interactive real-time applications (VoIP, video conferencing) and provides excellent quality-to-bitrate ratio.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sample rate: 48kHz (high quality voice)</li>
        <li>Frame size: 20ms (960 samples)</li>
        <li>Bitrate: 16-128 kbps adaptive</li>
        <li>Complexity: 10 (maximum quality)</li>
        <li>VBR enabled (variable bitrate for efficiency)</li>
        <li>FEC enabled (forward error correction for packet loss resilience)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Bitrate Configuration</h4>
      <p>Phone currently uses fixed Opus bitrate for reliability:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bitrate: 24 kbps (balance of quality and bandwidth)</li>
        <li>Conservative setting ensures consistent quality across network conditions</li>
        <li>Future releases will implement adaptive bitrate based on network conditions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Planned adaptive bitrate:</strong> Measure packet loss rate and round-trip time to dynamically adjust between 16-128 kbps. Bitrate changes gradual to avoid abrupt quality shifts.</p>
      
      <p>Phone includes audio processing pipeline for improved call quality:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Noise gate:</strong> Basic threshold-based noise suppression (configurable 0.0-0.5 threshold)</li>
        <li><strong>Echo cancellation:</strong> NLMS adaptive filter (50ms, basic implementation - headset recommended)</li>
        <li><strong>Gain control:</strong> Simple multiplication-based volume adjustment (0-200%)</li>
        <li><strong>Jitter buffer:</strong> Adaptive buffer (50-200ms) smooths packet arrival time variations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Current audio processing is functional but basic. Advanced features (RNNoise deep learning noise reduction, sophisticated AEC for speaker+mic setups, automatic gain control) are planned for future releases. For best quality, use headsets to avoid acoustic feedback.</p>
      
      <h3>2.4 Session Management</h3>
      
      <h4>Call Initiation</h4>
      <p>Caller initiates session by sending signed invitation to recipient (or rendezvous gate if recipient offline):</p>
      
      <pre><code>{
  "type": "call_invite",
  "caller_id": "pool_id:member_id",
  "recipient_id": "pool_id:member_id",
  "timestamp": 1640000000,
  "ephemeral_key": "x25519_public_key",
  "signature": "ed25519_signature"
}</code></pre>
      
      <p>Recipient receives invitation, performs authentication and permission checks, responds with acceptance or rejection:</p>
      
      <pre><code>{
  "type": "call_accept",
  "caller_id": "pool_id:member_id",
  "recipient_id": "pool_id:member_id",
  "ephemeral_key": "x25519_public_key",
  "signature": "ed25519_signature"
}</code></pre>
      
      <p>After mutual acceptance, both parties derive shared secret and begin sending encrypted audio packets.</p>
      
      <h4>Call Termination</h4>
      <p>Either party can end call by sending termination message or closing UDP socket. Graceful termination preferred (allows final audio packets to arrive) but connection failure handled automatically:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>If no packets received for 10 seconds: assume connection lost, terminate locally</li>
        <li>If explicit termination message received: acknowledge and close</li>
        <li>If NAT hole closes (detected by failed keepalives): attempt re-establishment, terminate if unsuccessful</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2.5 Metadata Minimization</h3>
      
      <p>Phone minimizes metadata leakage through architectural choices:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No centralized call logs:</strong> No server records who called whom, when, or duration. Call history stored locally only (user-controlled).</li>
        <li><strong>Rendezvous gates are stateless:</strong> Gates facilitate connection but don't log. Gate operators see IP addresses during setup but not call content or metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>Pool state minimal:</strong> Pool consensus tracks membership and trust scores, but not individual call records.</li>
        <li><strong>Local-only history:</strong> Users can delete call history locally at any time. No recovery from servers (because none exists).</li>
        <li><strong>Ephemeral keys:</strong> Per-session keys mean no persistent cryptographic identity beyond pool membership.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>However, some metadata necessarily exists:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Rendezvous gates temporarily observe IP addresses (for NAT traversal)</li>
        <li>ISPs can observe UDP traffic patterns (though not content)</li>
        <li>Pool members know you're online (presence required for call routing)</li>
        <li>Call participants obviously know about calls with each other</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Phone does not claim to eliminate all metadata, only to minimize what's collected and avoid centralized metadata databases.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Implementation Notes -->
    <div class="paper-section">
      <h2>3. Implementation Considerations</h2>
      
      <h3>3.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
      
      <p>Real-time voice imposes strict latency constraints:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Target latency:</strong> <150ms end-to-end (acceptable for natural conversation)</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum latency:</strong> <300ms (conversation possible but feels laggy)</li>
        <li><strong>Jitter tolerance:</strong> <50ms variation (beyond this, jitter buffer cannot compensate)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Latency budget breakdown:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio capture: 20ms (frame size)</li>
        <li>Encoding: 5-10ms (Opus encoding)</li>
        <li>Network transmission: 50-100ms (internet RTT)</li>
        <li>Jitter buffer: 50-100ms (smoothing packet arrival)</li>
        <li>Decoding: 5-10ms (Opus decoding)</li>
        <li>Audio playback: 20ms (frame size)</li>
        <li><strong>Total: 150-260ms typical</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3.2 Platform Support</h3>
      
      <p>Phone targets desktop platforms initially (Linux, macOS, Windows) with mobile (iOS, Android) planned for future releases.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Desktop implementation:</strong> Rust for core protocol, platform-specific audio APIs (ALSA/PulseAudio on Linux, CoreAudio on macOS, WASAPI on Windows via cpal). Basic audio processing pipeline (noise gate, NLMS echo cancellation, gain control). Functional but headsets strongly recommended.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Current limitations:</strong> Echo cancellation is basic NLMS implementation (50ms filter), insufficient for internal mic + speaker setups. Advanced acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) requiring longer filters and multi-channel processing planned for future releases.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Mobile challenges:</strong> Background execution restrictions (iOS especially), battery optimization requirements, push notifications for offline call invitations, platform-specific NAT behavior, more sophisticated echo cancellation needed for mobile device acoustics.</p>
      
      <h3>3.3 Scaling Considerations</h3>
      
      <p>Phone architecture scales horizontally through distributed pool model:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Each pool operates independently (no global coordination required)</li>
        <li>Rendezvous gates are stateless (can run unlimited instances)</li>
        <li>P2P connections remove server bandwidth bottleneck</li>
        <li>No global directory service (no single point of failure/overload)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>However, very large pools (1000+ members) present challenges:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Presence broadcast (announcing online status to all members) becomes expensive</li>
        <li>Pool state synchronization bandwidth grows with member count</li>
        <li>Social moderation breaks down (Dunbar's number ~150)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Pools should split when exceeding 150-200 members, creating sub-pools with governance-managed trust relationships between them (Level 2 pool whitelist).</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Future Work -->
    <div class="paper-section">
      <h2>4. Future Work</h2>
      
      <h3>4.1 Group Calling</h3>
      <p>Current specification describes 1-to-1 calling. Group calling (conference calls) requires additional protocol work:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Mesh topology (each participant sends to all others) vs. SFU topology (centralized forwarding)</li>
        <li>Key agreement for N-party sessions</li>
        <li>Permission model for group invitations</li>
        <li>Bandwidth considerations (mesh requires N upload streams)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4.2 Video Calling</h3>
      <p>Video adds significant complexity:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Higher bandwidth requirements (100-1000+ kbps vs. 16-128 kbps for audio)</li>
        <li>Codec selection (H.264, VP8, VP9, AV1 tradeoffs)</li>
        <li>Screen sharing capabilities</li>
        <li>UI considerations (video presence more intrusive than audio)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4.3 Asynchronous Voice Messages</h3>
      <p>Voice messages (recorded audio sent asynchronously) complement real-time calling:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Less intrusive than calls (recipient listens when convenient)</li>
        <li>More natural than text for some communications</li>
        <li>Different permission model (easier to accept messages than calls)</li>
        <li>Storage and delivery mechanism required</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4.4 Integration with Other Communication Tools</h3>
      <p>Phone could integrate with text messaging, file sharing, screen sharing within unified interface while maintaining separate permission models appropriate to each medium.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="paper-section">
      <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
      
      <p>Phone provides secure voice calling infrastructure for trusted groups through explicit permission model prioritizing security over convenience. Pool-internal calling works immediately with zero friction. External calling is opt-in through four security levels that trade security for reach on user's terms.</p>
      
      <p>The architecture leverages Node's trust infrastructure (Argon2id authentication, witness verification, trust scores, pool consensus) rather than rebuilding identity system. This dependency is architectural necessity, not arbitrary coupling - voice infrastructure requires anti-sybil, revocation, and accountability mechanisms that Phone cannot provide independently.</p>
      
      <p>Phone is not a phone replacement. It solves different problems than PSTN or commercial VoIP services, optimizing for trust and privacy within bounded communities rather than universal reachability. This scoping is intentional. The friction of Node pool membership and explicit security choices prevents viral consumer growth but enables stronger guarantees for target use cases.</p>
      
      <p>Attack resistance comes from multiple layers: computational cost (Argon2id), human verification (witnesses), time gates (15-day pool age), rate limiting, governance-based revocation, and user-controlled permission levels. No single defense is perfect, but combination creates expensive and detectable attack surface.</p>
      
      <p>Phone accepts certain limitations as necessary tradeoffs: cannot call anyone (only pool members by default), requires Node membership (onboarding friction), smaller network (not suitable for mass consumer market). These limitations enable guarantees impossible in open systems: no spam by default, no anonymous harassment, no corporate surveillance, governance-based accountability.</p>
      
      <p>The permission model is honest about tradeoffs. Level 0 provides maximum security at cost of external reach. Level 3 provides maximum reach at cost of spam exposure. Users choose their position on security/accessibility spectrum with full knowledge of consequences. Marketing does not promise impossible outcomes.</p>
      
      <p>For teams, organizations, activists, and families who need secure voice communication within trusted groups, Phone provides infrastructure that respects privacy, enables accountability, and refuses compromise on core security properties. This is enough.</p>
